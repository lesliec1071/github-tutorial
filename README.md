## Git vs. GitHub
_Git_ is a system for version control used by programmers & runs command line on local machine & keeps track of the files & modifies it if needed (repo) 
_Github_ is a website that allows people to upload git repositories online & backups files, navigate repos & repo collaboration.

## Workflow & Commands
When you save your work, you are saving the changes you made to your file therefore, your work won't erase.
After you would _git add (filename)_ so your work (the file) can be added to the reository.
Then you would _git commit -m_ so your changes would be secure and permenatly saved. 
Last you would _git push_ so your work & the changes will appear on the IDE and Github.
